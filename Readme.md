# Play Lyriks

This project is a `music` player in React.

### Purpose:

For practice react app with tailwind css
Started this project on `October 6, 2022`.

### Credit:

Credit goes to [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cpb0tYV74&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery).

### How to Run:

- we need `api key`, for this create account on Rapid Api and get that key.
- create `.env` file inside frontend folder.
- create the following `variable` and add api after it in .env, `REACT_APP_SHAZAM_CORE_RAPID_API_KEY =`.
- Go to directory 'frontend' with `cd frontend` command and start with `npm start`.
- If already starated project without .env file then, clear the cache with `npm cache clean --force` and run the server again.

### Technologies:

- redux
- tailwind css
- [shazamCore](https://rapidapi.com/tipsters/api/shazam-core) from RapidApi Hub

### Cons (in my point of view):

if you wanna practice it just for `redux` then not go fot it, because redux not implemented properly in some cases, we still passing data from child components to its  child components, while `main benefit of redux` is not to pass data to components to components, get it from global state.
